# Next-Gen-Jeopardy

This is a Jeopardy simulation that allows multiple teams of three players to enjoy together.

Users will be able to answer a large array of questions regarding various categories. 

The code will also allow users to choose the number of teams up to 3 (one person per team).  

Within the software, we will implement four different columns showcasing the question categories as headers along with the six rows below with the number of points ranging from 100-500. 

Once a user selects a particular cell within the rows under a certain category, the player will have to manually input their answers into a textbox.

Within the programming, we will install a function that will showcase a red “Incorrect”  as well as the correct answer whenever an individual answers incorrectly.

If a player answers correctly, that person will receive the dollar value of the amount showcased on the selected question. 

There will be a function that deducts the dollar value of the selected question if a player answers incorrectly or fails to answer within the time given.

Players will also be allowed to receive 1 clue.

If the first player answers inccorectly, the turn goes to second player.

Whichever team has the most money at the end of the game wins.

Enjoy!
